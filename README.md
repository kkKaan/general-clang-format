# A General .clang-format Configuration

This repository contains a .clang-format file, which is used to configure the formatting style for C++ code using the Clang-Format tool. The configuration file specifies various formatting rules and preferences to ensure consistent and readable code across different projects. This file is created as a mixture of settings from various C++ standards, like [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), and [LLVM Coding Standards](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html). 

## Usage

To use this .clang-format configuration file in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. **Download**: Download the .clang-format file from this repository.

2. **Integration**: Place the .clang-format file in the root directory of your C++ project.

3. **Usage**: When running Clang-Format on your C++ code, it will automatically use the formatting rules specified in the .clang-format file placed in the project directory.

## Configuration Details

The .clang-format file in this repository specifies formatting rules and preferences for C++ code, including:

- Indentation settings
- Brace wrapping preferences
- Line breaking rules
- Spacing and alignment options
- Comment formatting rules
- Code block organization preferences
- And more...

## Customization

Feel free to customize the provided .clang-format file according to your project's specific requirements and coding style preferences. You can adjust indentation widths, brace wrapping settings, spacing rules, and other formatting options to suit your needs.

With the configurations, I added the other possible choices and some small explanations for most of them, but for all other settings and more detailed information on the available formatting options and their effects, refer to the official Clang-Format documentation: [Clang-Format Documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html).
